Last night coincidentally I was telling my teammates what this Lady is saying in this video. My experiences with interviews is like this;  

I did 6-7 interviews and got 5 offers in total as at now.  3 of those offers I got compliments from the hiring managers that they liked the way I talked, my confidence and how I hold conversations plus my technical skills and that’s what they are looking for. I knew I would be hired from my first interview with these 3 companies. 

You could be very knowledgeable and don’t get hired bc cultural fit and personality is a big deal in hiring. ( A recruiter gave me this tips when I started interviewing) 

During interviews, ask about their day, and throw in something like oh how was the weekend or anything different but be professional and keep it cute! And of course thank them for creating time to have that interview with you.  This will make you to be relax a little bit and smile when necessary too. Don’t talk over anyone. Listen and only respond when they are done. Nod your head when necessary to show that you are following. Like I said last time, go through their website thoroughly and their LinkedIn. You will always find something you can ask them. These are things that sets you apart. 
Stop asking the general questions that everyone asks about what they expect from a new hire. That’s boring. Ask something different about their company which is deep. 
I remember asking a solution company these questions. 

1) How do they manage scope creep with their clients. ( Go search what scope creep is) 

2) How do they make sure they maintain their business deadlines and requirements so as to have great relationships with their clients 

3) Since they are solutions company, how do they tell clients which tools to use or how do they introduce the concept of new tools to their clients? For example, how do you tell your clients to start using Kubernetes instead of Dockerswarm?

I don’t have any DevOps certification and 
only one company asked if I had any and I said no! About why I left my current career path,
I told them my passion for automation and technology as a whole.
Had always wanted to do something in tech but didn’t know what to do until a friend introduced DevOps to me and after my research, 
I realized it fits well with my personality bc I like collaborating with people and DevOps is all about reducing silos and 
working together plus creating ways to automate manual tasks. 
I did bootcamp and lots of udemy and other online studies to get started with my DevOps career. 
That’s how I answered that question.
